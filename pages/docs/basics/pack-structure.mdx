# Pack Structure

This page will explain how Java Edition resource packs are structured, and therefores gives an idea of how to create your first resource pack from scratch.

## Overview

```text title={Default Resources}
ðŸ“¦Root
 â”£ ðŸ“‚assets
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚minecraft
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚blockstates
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚font
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚icons
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚lang
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚models
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚block
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚item

 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚resourcepacks
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚shaders
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚post

 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œsounds.json
 â”£ ðŸ“œpack.mcmeta
 â”— ðŸ“œpack.png
```

## Root Items

These items are not in any folder of the resource pack. It is important to note when compressing a resource pack that these items should be compressed at the same level as the assets folder. A compressed resource pack will not load if compressed from the enclosing folder.

### pack.mcmeta

Files of the extension `.mcmeta` use the JSON syntax. Here is an excerpt of this file from the vanilla pack:

```json title={pack.mcmeta} highlights={10-11}
{
  "language": {
    "en_us": {
      "region": "US",
      "name": "English",
      "bidirectional": false
    }
  },
  "pack": {
    "description": "The default look and feel of Minecraft",
    "pack_format": 6
  }
}
```

Though this example defines languages, this is not nesscescary unless defining a new language. The main section with which the average user should be concerned is the highlighted lines above, which specify the description of the pack visible in the resource pack switcher, and the pack format. Pack format is based on the Minecraft version with which the pack is compatible.

Currently, valid values for `pack_format` are:
- `1`: 1.6.1 to 1.8.9
- `2`: 1.9 to 1.10.2
- `3`: 1.11 to 1.12.2
- `4`: 1.13 to 1.14.4
- `5`: 1.15 to 1.16.1
- `6`: 1.16.2 to 1.16.5
- `7`: 1.17 and above

### pack.png

The `pack.png` should be a square image, though non-square images will be stretched to conform to a square proportion. Any resolution is acceptable.

## Assets

The assets folder contains all of the packs media assets. It encloses the namespace folders.

### Namespaces

Namespaces are a rarely utilized feature of Java Editon resource packs. The namespace folders exist immediately after the assets folder. The default namespace is `minecraft`, which is the most commonly utilized. To reference assets from a specific namespace in a resource pack when specifying a file path, the path is prefixed with the namepace and a colon.

Take the following parented model:

```json title={model.json} highlights={3-5,7}
{
    "textures": {
        "1": "minecraft:block/acacia_log",
        "2": "item/acacia_boat",
        "3": "custom:item/custom_texture"
    },
    "parent": "custom:block/custom_model"
}
```

In the above example, the full paths at which assets would be referenced is as follows:
- Texture `"1"` would resolve to `/assets/minecraft/textures/block/acacia_log.png`
- Texture `"2"` would resolve to `/assets/minecraft/textures/item/acacia_boat.png`
- Texture `"3"` would resolve to `/assets/custom/textures/item/acacia_boat.png`
- The parent would resolve to `/assets/custom/models/block/custom_model.json`

### Block States

Block states are the properties held by placed blocks. Common examples of blockstates are `facing` and `type`, for example, of which `facing` species the direction that a block faces, and `type` specifies whether a slab is top, bottom, or double. Block states are defined by the JSON files held in the `blockstates` folder. Different block states or combonations of block states can correspond to different models, as well as axis rotations.

### Font

The `font` folder contains the configuration information for fonts. This includes `glyph_sizes.bin`, defining the widths of characters used for the unicode font. Three JSON files, uniform.json, `default.json`, and `alt.json`, are present in the default pack. The file `alt.json` lists the provider exclusively for the enchantment table font, while `uniform.json` exclusively lists the provider for the legacy unicode font. The file `default.json` can be used to define new main fonts. These can be of the type `bitmap`, utilized by Minecraft's default font, or `ttf` for TrueType fonts. Bitmap fonts are stored in a subfolder of textures, while TureType fonts are stored directly in this `font` folder.

### Icons

The `icons` folder contains the application icons for Minecraft. These icons, however, cannot be pulled directly from a resource pack at this time.

### Lang

The `lang` folder contains JSON values that consist of key-value pairs in which the key is the identifier for some string used in the game, and the value is the string when that language file is applied. Language files are generalled named with a two letter contry code seperated by an underscore from a two letter language code.

### Models

The `models` folder holds the JSON files that create the games models. These JSON files are constructed with four main fields, `textures`, `elements`, `display`, and `parent`. They can be described as follows:
- `textures` maps texture paths to shortnames which can be referenced by the faces of elements
- `elements` defined all the cubes in the model, their sizes, positions, and textues and UV values of each face
- `display` sets the appearance of a model in terms of scale, position, and rotation for different slots and perspectives, as well as item drops, item frames, and GUI
- `parent`, when specified, pulls any of the non-specified previous fields from the specified parent model

### Particles

The `particles` folder contains a JSON file for each particle that specifies an array of textures for the given particle. These textures must be present in the `particle` subfolder of the `textures` folder. When multiple textures are defined for a single particle, this produces a framewise animated particle texture.

### Resourcepacks

The `resourcepacks` folder of the default resource pack contains `programmer_art.zip`, which provides the legacy Minecraft textures. Like the `icons` folder, this cannot currently be utilized by custom resource packs.

### Shaders

The `shaders` folder is comprised of three subfolders, `core`, `post`, and `program`. In general, shaders affect how the game is rendered. 

#### Program

The `program` subfolder is comprised of JSON files that specifcy a vertex and fragment shader.

#### Post

The `post` subfolder contains shaders written in GLSL, Open GL Shader Language, in the form of vertex shaders (`.vsh`) and fragment shaders (`.fsh`). Vertex shaders are applied to all vertexes, the point where the corners of planes intersect, while fragment shaders are applied to each pixel.

#### Core

The `core` subfolder defines shader programs that are directly utilized by the game.

### Sounds

The `sounds` folder contains all the sounds for the game. This folder does not ship with the version JAR, and must be extracted from the hashed assets in the assets folder of the Minecraft folder. All sounds are of the OGG format and use the [Vorbis](https://xiph.org/vorbis/) audio codec. These sounds are triggered in game by sound events defined in `sounds.json`, which exists in the namespace folder, above the sounds folder. Events can contain mutliple sounds from which a random sound will be chosen. Weight, volume, and pitch can also be controlled on a per event basis. A subtitle event can also be defined for each sound event, the value of which can then be specified in a language file. 

### Texts

The texts folder contains three plain text files with the extension `.txt`, `credits.txt`, `end.txt`, and `splashes.txt`. The file `credits.txt` contains the game scrolling credits and utilize book-style color codes with the `Â§` symbol. The `end.txt` file defines a poem that scrolls when the Enderdragon is defeated, and also uses color codes.The final file, `splashes.txt`, does not utilize color codes. It specifies the random phrases that appear on the start game splash screen.

### Textures

The `textures` folder contains all game textures. Textures must utilize the png format. In previous versions, textures were required to be square. This is no longer the case. Textures sometimes are accompanied by `.mcmeta` files that specify texture animation. These folders take the full filename of the texture with extensions, followed by `.mcmeta`.
